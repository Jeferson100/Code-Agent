    Use this tool after each search to analyze results and plan next steps systematically.
    This creates a deliberate pause in the research workflow for quality decision-making.

    When to use:
    - After receiving search results: What key information did I find?
    - Before deciding next steps: Do I have enough to answer comprehensively?
    - When assessing research gaps: What specific information am I still missing?
    - Before concluding research: Can I provide a complete answer now?

    Reflection should address:
    1. Analysis of current findings - What concrete information have I gathered?
    2. Gap assessment - What crucial information is still missing?
    3. Quality evaluation - Do I have sufficient evidence/examples for a good answer?
    4. Strategic decision - Should I continue searching or provide my answer?

        reflection: Your detailed reflection on research progress, findings, gaps, and next steps

    When to use:
    - After collecting all necessary information about the coding task
    - Before writing the final code solution
    - When analyzing requirements and constraints
    - Before structuring the complete response

    Analysis should address:
    1. Requirements analysis - What exactly needs to be implemented?
    2. Solution approach - What's the best technical approach?
    3. Code structure - How should the solution be organized?
    4. Edge cases and considerations - What potential issues need handling?
    5. Explanation strategy - How to best explain the solution?
